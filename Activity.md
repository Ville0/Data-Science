**How do search engines work?**
-Search engines work through three primary functions:
-**Crawling**: Scour the Internet for content, looking over the code/content for each URL they find.
-**Indexing**: Store and organize the content found during the crawling process. Once a page is in the index, itâ€™s in the running to be displayed as a result to relevant queries.
-**Ranking**: Provide the pieces of content that will best answer a searcher's query, which means that results are ordered by most relevant to least relevant.
