 <br/>**Indexing**: Store and organize the content found during the crawling process. Once a page is in the index, itâ€™s in the running to be displayed as a result to relevant queries. <br/>**Ranking**: Provide the pieces of content that will best answer a searcher's query, which means that results are ordered by most relevant to least relevant.
